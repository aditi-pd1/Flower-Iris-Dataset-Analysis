# Flower-Iris-Dataset-Analysis
We will discuss how to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the Iris dataset. Before continuing with this article, we have used two terns i.e. EDA and Iris Dataset. Let’s see a brief about these datasets :
_`Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)`_ is a technique to analyze data using some visual Techniques. With this technique, we can get detailed information about the statistical summary of the data. We will also be able to deal with the duplicates values, outliers, and also see some trends or patterns present in the dataset.
_`Iris Dataset`_ is considered as the Hello World for data science. It contains five columns namely – Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal Width, and Species Type. Iris is a flowering plant, the researchers have measured various features of the different iris flowers and recorded them digitally.

# Highlights
1. __Simple Dataset__: Iris dataset is a straightforward and easy-to-understand dataset, making it ideal for beginners.
2. __Multi-Class Classification__: It's a classic example of a multi-class classification problem, where the goal is to classify iris flowers into one of three species based on their measurements.
3. __Feature Engineering__: The dataset can be used to practice feature engineering techniques, such as normalization, scaling, and feature selection.
4. __Machine Learning Algorithms__: It's a common dataset for experimenting with various machine learning algorithms like decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.
5. __Data Visualization__: The dataset can be used to create informative visualizations, such as scatter plots, histograms, and box plots, to gain insights into the data.
